# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## The Task

Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

# Project Description
This tool generates an HTML page for input of a team profile.  

# Usage Information
use npm install to install all required dependenceies. Answer all prompts and navigate the menu via up and down arrows. Once completed, select exit and then an HTML will be created. 

# Installation Instructions
Run npm i to install all dependencies.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
```
